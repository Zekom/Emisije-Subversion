GitHub Pages Basics / Creating Pages with the automatic generator
Creating Pages with the automatic generator

You can use GitHub's Automatic Page Generator to quickly create a website for a project, user, or organization.
User and Organization Pages

To generate User and Organization Pages sites, you'll need to create a repository named username.github.io . The username or organization name must be your own or your GitHub Pages site will not build. The automatic page generator is accessible via the repository's Settings page. You can read more about User and Organization Pages here.

Warning: GitHub Pages sites are publicly available on the internet, even if their repositories are private. If you have sensitive data in your Page repository, you may want to remove it before publishing.
Project Pages

You can use the automatic page generator to publish GitHub Pages sites for any project repository.

Warning: You must create the repository with the naming convention described above or you will not be able to publish your GitHub Pages site.
